# Data_Wrangling
 Data wrangling was performed for clinical trial.
 
 This data wrangling followed the programmatic data cleaning process:

Define: convert our assessments into defined cleaning tasks. These definitions also serve as an instruction list so others (or yourself in the future) can look at your work and reproduce it.
Code: convert those definitions to code and run that code.
Test: test your dataset, visually or with code, to make sure your cleaning operations worked.
