# Data_Wrangling
 Data wrangling was performed for clinical trial.
 
Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I documented wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.
 
 This data wrangling followed the programmatic data cleaning process:

Define: convert our assessments into defined cleaning tasks. These definitions also serve as an instruction list so others (or yourself in the future) can look at your work and reproduce it.
Code: convert those definitions to code and run that code.
Test: test your dataset, visually or with code, to make sure your cleaning operations worked.
